Our behaviour, style, value etc. vary with the person to person, we interact on daily basis. It depends upon the type of relationship with others. We tend to be respectful while talking to the person who comes in the upper level of hierarchical order. Parents & Friends lies in two different levels, thus our communication style differs in a respective way.

First of all, The relationship with the parent is of high value, thus there is a use of formal language. We become respectful to the parents while the same doesn't happen with our friends. Friends are at the same level, hence we are more informal, comfortable and less chance of awkwardness in our behaviour. And it is because we share the same value in life experience.

In the first case, there is a difference in behaviour while interacting with parents and friends. There is also a difference in the subject, we talk. Being respectful to parent comes at the cost of being limited in subjects and matters we discuss. Talking to parents over sensitive topics requires courage and support while the happening of the same with friends is rare. Things are not only limited to this but there is also fear and disappointment we receive from parents. 

Now, here comes the most important part; that is the reason for communication - either we seek an advisor or just a listener. Most of the time parents acts as an advisor while friends act as a listener. Parents holding more experience thus are suitable for guiding us and providing the right path in life. And friends belongs to our values thus suitable for sharing our experience freely.

Overall, parents & friends have two different roles in our life therefore there is two different behaviour and style in communication. We expect to receive advice from the parent on some topics or life situation while opinions from friends.
